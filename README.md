This is a project I'm doing for IT Career switch. It's a geolocation website that is various device friendly. It uses PHP, Ajax, jQuery, Javascript, CSS and HTML, I've also made use of bootstrap for the visual styling. It relies on various APIs and uses Leaflet for the maps. By clicking on a country in the Country List it pans to the country and displays various info in a modal. I've also used clustered markers to display different transport hubs throughout the countries on the map.
