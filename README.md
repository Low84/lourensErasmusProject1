This is a project I'm doing for IT Career switch. It's a geolocation website that is various device friendly. It uses PHP, Ajax, jQuery, Javascript, CSS and HTML, I've also made use of bootstrap for the visual styling. A map is rendered using leaflet and a map tilelayer.It relies on various APIs which gets called using ajax. By selecting a country in the Country List it pans to the country and displays various info in a modal. It also adds cluster markers which shows cities and their population for the selected country. Using L.icon I've added custom markers to the map showing the cities locations. I've used various resources for help when I got stuck, including stackoverflow, github general searches on Google and my tutor.
